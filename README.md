# Ganna Clone: A Music Player App

## Project Overview

This project is a clone of the popular music streaming platform, Ganna. It's a breakthrough project for me as it's the first time I've built a large-scale project without following any tutorials. Despite some code repetition and unconventional file structure, this project has been a great learning experience.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register and sign in to access the music player.
- **Music Player**: Users can sign in and add songs to their playlist after signing in.

## Tech Stack

The project is built using the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: A React framework for production-grade applications.
- **@emotion/react and @emotion/styled**: Libraries for writing CSS styles with JavaScript.
- **@mui/material and @mui/icons-material**: Material-UI components for faster and easier web development.

## API

The data for the songs is provided by Newton API.

## Learnings

This project has been a significant learning curve, especially in terms of component reusability and the fundamentals of building large projects. It has also helped me understand the importance of decision-making in software development.

## Future Work

I plan to continue refining the project, focusing on improving the code structure and reducing repetition. I'm also considering expanding the project's scope and adding more features.
